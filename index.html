      I completed finals the week of my 60th birthday, something I am proud of. In 1980 I received a B.S. in Biology, but this
      Associate's Degree in Computer Graphics Technology means even more to me. Each thing I have learned has made me that
      much more capable in today's world, allowing me to find job opportunities that I couldn't have taken advantage of
      before. KCC has made a huge difference in my life, both in learning and in the people I have come to know&nbsp;here.

      I'm the first one in my family to graduate. The professors would take their time to know you. That's what I really liked
      about this. It was smaller....everybody knows you here. I really liked KCC. I'm really excited to see where this takes
      me&nbsp;next.
